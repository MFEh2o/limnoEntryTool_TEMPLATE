## The 'sampleSheets/' folder

This directory will contain sample sheets. To create a new sample sheet, copy the template sheet from the root directory and put the copy here. Change the name accordingly. Do NOT modify the original template sample sheet.

Don't delete this README document--if you do, then the 'sampleSheets/' folder won't show up in this template repository on GitHub. Git can't handle empty directories.
